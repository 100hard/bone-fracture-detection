# Bone Fracture Detection System

An AI-powered web application that detects bone fractures in X-ray images using deep learning.

## Live Demo
[**Try the app here**](your-streamlit-app-url.streamlit.app)

## Project Overview

This project implements a computer vision classifier to detect bone fractures in X-ray images. Using a ResNet-18 architecture trained on the Kaggle Bone Fracture Dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bmadushanirodrigo/fracture-multi-region-x-ray-data, the model can distinguish between fractured and non-fractured bones with high accuracy.

### Key Features
- **Real-time prediction** on uploaded X-ray images
- **Interactive web interface** built with Streamlit
- **Confidence scores** for each prediction
- **Professional medical-style reporting**
- **Mobile-friendly responsive design**

## Model Performance
- **Architecture**: ResNet-18 (modified for grayscale input)
- **Dataset**: Kaggle Bone Fracture Multiregion Dataset
- **Accuracy**: ~96.6% on test data
- **Classes**: Fractured, Not Fractured

## Tech Stack
- **Deep Learning**: PyTorch, TorchVision
- **Web App**: Streamlit
- **Image Processing**: PIL, OpenCV
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib
- **Deployment**: Streamlit Community Cloud

## Local Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/100hard/bone-fracture-detection.git
   cd bone-fracture-detector
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. **Open your browser** to `http://localhost:8501`

## How It Works

1. **Image Upload**: Users upload X-ray images through the web interface
2. **Preprocessing**: Images are resized to 224x224, converted to grayscale, and normalized
3. **Prediction**: ResNet-18 model processes the image and outputs probabilities
4. **Results**: Users see fracture detection results with confidence scores
5. **Recommendations**: Medical-style recommendations based on predictions

## Important Disclaimers

- **Educational Purpose Only**: This application is designed for educational and demonstration purposes
- **Not Medical Advice**: Results should never replace professional medical consultation
- **Accuracy Limitations**: While the model shows good performance, it may not detect all types of fractures
- **Professional Consultation Required**: Always consult healthcare professionals for medical diagnosis

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Support for multiple bone types (arm, leg, spine, etc.)
- [ ] Integration with DICOM medical imaging format
- [ ] Batch processing for multiple images
- [ ] Export reports as PDF
- [ ] Model interpretability with grad-CAM visualizations

## Model Training Details

The model was trained using:
- **Base Architecture**: ResNet-18 pre-trained on ImageNet
- **Modifications**: 
  - First convolutional layer adapted for single-channel (grayscale) input
  - Final fully connected layer modified for binary classification
- **Training Strategy**: Transfer learning with fine-tuning
- **Optimization**: Adam optimizer with learning rate 0.001
- **Training Duration**: 10 epochs
